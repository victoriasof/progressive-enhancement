<h3>The story</h3>

    <p>
        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers"> We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"> <em>Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers"> Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"> <em>Maybe</em>.</q>

        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers"> Oh dear, that’s too bad, </q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"> <em>Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers"> Isn’t that great! </q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"> <em>Maybe</em>.</q>

        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <tag attribute="good">good</tag> or <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <tag attribute="good">good</tag> fortune.

<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<blockquote>
    <tag attribute="good">Good</tag> and <tag attribute="bad">Bad</tag> are just one perspective. Bananas are <tag attribute="good">good</tag> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <tag attribute="good">good</tag> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
